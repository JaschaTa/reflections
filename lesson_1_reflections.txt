What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You can define when it makes sense to save
    You define when a logical change happened

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Files can be dependend on each other, so it makes sense to always save a version of a complete repository

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log resp. git log --stat to show changelog
    git diff [commit id 1] [commit id 2] to show changes in commits

could break something?

    you can restore easily previous commits as changes are highlighted
