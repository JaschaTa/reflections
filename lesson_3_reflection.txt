When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working with multiple people on the same project
  When working from different laptops on the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  There might be cases in which I would like to work with a version different than
  the one uploaded in github
  In general it gives more flexibility compared to automatic updates

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  branches: used within same repository, e.g. to create different versions of a code
  clones: copies a repo (i) from GitHub to local workspace, or (ii) from a local workspace to another
  forges: copies a repo from GitHub to own GitHub account

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  you can track easier changes that have been done by other people
  you can avoid merging conflicts better
