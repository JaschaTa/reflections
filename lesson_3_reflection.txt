When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working with multiple people on the same project
  When working from different laptops on the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  There might be cases in which I would like to work with a version different than
  the one uploaded in github
  In general it gives more flexibility compared to automatic updates
